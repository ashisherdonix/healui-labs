## 🏥 Clinical Standards Implemented

### ✅ CF Codes (Canadian Fitness)
- **Functional goals** for mobility and self-care
- **ICF domain classifications** for therapeutic exercises
- **Evidence-based functional outcomes** mapping

### ✅ SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine)
- **Medical conditions** with validated clinical codes
- **Anatomy references** using standardized terminology
- **100% coverage** of all 150 conditions

### ✅ LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes)
- **Assessment tools** with proper clinical measurement codes
- **Outcome measures** for evidence-based practice
- **Comprehensive metrics** for patient evaluation

## 📊 Data Statistics

| Entity Type | Count | Coverage | Standards |
|-------------|--------|----------|-----------|
